# George Silver challenges Vincentio Saviolo to duel!

While George Silver's martial lineage is unknown, he was possessed of strong opinions about the 
proper method of fencing and was strongly opposed to the contemporary Continental fencing 
traditions. He was particularly critical of the Italian masters who had set up schools in 
London, including Rocco Bonetti and Vincentio Saviolo. He and Toby went so far as to challenge 
Saviolo to a public fencing match to demonstrate the superiority of his British arts, 
but even though they placarded London, Southwark, and Westminster with the challenge, and had 
it carried to Saviolo personally on the appointed day, Silver states that no formal match 
occurred.
